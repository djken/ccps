She has a broken hip and a lot of bruises. She had surgery on Friday. The doctor fixed her hip. He inserted some metal pins into the bone. The pins hold the bone together. She has to stay in the hospital for a few weeks. She needs to stay in bed so her hip can heal. The hospital is boring. She doesn't have many things to do. I am going to visit her a few times every week. We can play cards or watch movies together.</p>

We invited our relatives. My mom cooked her favorite food and baked a cake. We played games and looked at old pictures. My grandmother opened her gifts. She enjoyed the evening. Everyone stayed for a long time. My mom said to sleep early. I asked her if I could stay up. She said I could stay up for another hour. After an hour, I tried to sleep. I closed my eyes, but I couldn't fall asleep. I stared at the clock. I finally fell asleep after midnight.</p>

I have a big tournament next weekend. It is for the championship. Afterward, my mom and I went to a shopping center to buy a birthday gift for my best friend, Sally. I picked a sweater in her favorite color. Then, I went home to take a shower. We had to leave for the birthday party after my shower. We went roller skating. I had so much fun. At the roller-skating rink, we ordered pizza and had cake and ice cream. After dinner, she opened her presents. She really liked my gift. My dad picked me up at the rink. On the way home, my dad's car got a flat tire. He changed it with the spare tire in the trunk. We finally arrived home.</p>

They were able to explain a few of the problems, but I was still having trouble with most of them. I don't know what I am doing wrong. My mom wants to hire a tutor. My dad thinks that is a good idea. I'm going to go talk to my teacher tomorrow. I hope he can help me. I need to pass this test.</p>

Each person was assigned a task for the project. She didn't do her share. Yesterday, we had a group meeting at the library to complete our project. We agreed to meet after school. We all went to the library, but she wasn't there. She didn't show up. We had to finish without her. I called her home. Her mom said she was at a friend's house. I saw her at school the next day. She said she didn't know about the meeting but I know she wasn't telling the truth. We reminded her many times. I really don't want work with her anymore.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">This morning, I had an accident while playing outside. I fell off my bicycle. Luckily, I had my helmet on. I hit my elbow on the ground and cut my hand. I also hurt my ankle. My parents took me to the hospital. It wasn't serious. They washed off the blood and put a bandage on my cut. After we got home, my parents let me rest on the couch. They gave me ice cream to make me feel better. I was worried my bicycle was broken. I love my bicycle. It was a birthday present from my grandparents. I want to ride it again. I hope my ankle gets better soon.</p>

Then, we came home and my mom made us lunch. We wanted to have a picnic in the backyard. My mom made sandwiches. We laid out a blanket on the grass. After we finished our lunch, my brother and I threw away our trash. My mom came outside with us to work in the yard. There was a storm last weekend so it was still a mess. The wind blew a lot of debris onto the lawn. I helped to rake the lawn and my brother mowed the grass. Many weeds grew in the garden this week. I pulled the weeds and my mom planted some new flowers. Then my dad came home after work. We decided to have a barbecue. We cooked hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill and relaxed in the yard. I'm so glad the weather is nice again.</p>

When I got there, I rang the doorbell. No one answered the door. I called his house. No one answered the phone either. I waited for him outside. I began to worry that something was wrong. He finally showed up with his parents. He didn't even say he was sorry. He said he forgot. I didn't believe him, but I forgave him anyway. His parents didn't even know I was coming. He didn't tell them. When we finally sat down to study, he turned on some loud music. His mom told him to turn it down because it was too noisy. Instead, he started singing really loudly. I finally had enough and went home. When I get mad at him, he doesn't even care. I don't know if I want to be his friend anymore.</p>

Then we had a picnic lunch. After lunch, we drove to the stadium to watch a professional soccer match. Our local team won so I was really happy. Then my mom cooked tacos for dinner. Tacos are my favorite. Plus, I finally found my library book. It was missing for two weeks. My mom accidentally put it away in my sister's room. Only one bad thing happened. I fought with my sister. She borrowed a dress from me and spilled something on it. She is going to get it cleaned but I'm worried that it is ruined. Otherwise it was a perfect day.</p>

Sometimes, I fall asleep. Other times, I bring a video to watch in the car. When we arrived, my grandmother was cooking my favorite food, spaghetti and meatballs. On Saturday, we went to the park and I met a friendly dog. We also went to the petting zoo in the park and fed the animals. A goose bit my finger. My finger bled, but I didn't cry. My grandmother put a bandage on it and it felt better. In the evening, we went out to dinner and saw a movie. On Sunday, we walked along the beach to collect seashells. My grandfather said he knew an area that had a lot of shells. So, he led us there. I collected so many shells. I'm going save them in a big shoebox. I love spending time with my grandparents. I can't wait to go back.</p>

Then the computer in the library crashed and I had to redo my essay. <br><br> After lunch, we had a surprise quiz. I don't think I did well on it. It was raining really hard after school, so I got soaked on the way to the bus. On the way home, our neighbor's dog escaped his yard and started chasing me. I jumped over our fence and tore my pants. What a terrible day. I really hope tomorrow is better.</p>

My parents drove us up to the mountains. Aaron took a lot of photos. We went sledding all day. Aaron was scared at first, but then he got used to it. <br> There is also a lake that freezes in the winter and you can walk across it. But my dad said it would be too dangerous, so we chose not to walk on it. After playing in the snow for a while, we decided to head back to the car. When we got back to the parking lot, snow had covered all of the cars. <br> We couldn't find ours. Other people were searching for their cars too. Aaron found it really amusing. We started brushing the snow off the cars with our mittens. We finally found ours. On the way home, Aaron and I were so tired. We both fell asleep with dreams about our next winter adventure.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">I was up way too late last night working on my history project. I waited until the last minute to finish it. I am giving a presentation in class today. I had to make a model of a historical site to go with the presentation. I built a model of the ancient pyramids of Egypt. <br> I spent a lot of time building the model. My dad helped me too. My older brother also lent a hand. I constructed the pyramids out of sugar cubes. Then I painted everything to make it look real. I think it looks great. <br> My dad took a picture of it and sent it to my grandparents. They were very impressed with it. I hope my teacher likes it too. My dad drove me to school because the model was too big for the bus. I studied my notes for the presentation in the car. I'm a little nervous about speaking in front of the class.</p>

We walked through the fruits and vegetables stands and bought some produce to take home. <br>On the walk home, it started to rain really hard. We had to seek shelter under a tree so we wouldn't get drenched. After it stopped raining, we saw a big rainbow in the sky. We both thought it was beautiful. In the afternoon, we went to the lake. <br> We brought a lunch with us and sat by the water to eat. We watched some birds diving in the water. One of them caught a huge fish. When we got home, I helped my mom with dinner. <br>We used the produce from the market. My mom taught me how to make a dessert with my favorite fruits. We ate on the patio and watched the sunset. I'm glad the rain didn't come back.</p>

My math homework was really difficult so I struggled to finish it. My parents tried to help me, but they also had trouble with it. When I was done, I needed to write a paragraph for English class. But my mom's laptop was acting up. I had to write it by hand. I will type it in the computer lab at school. Then I was going to study for my science test. But I could not find my textbook. I wasted an hour looking for it. I searched the whole house. Then, I remembered that I left it on my front porch. I was sitting with some friends yesterday after school. I left it on the chair outside. When I finally found it, it was getting very late. I studied until I could not stay awake any longer. My mother told me to go to bed. I really didn't get enough sleep. I must go school early this morning, so I can finish my English homework in the computer lab. I was hoping to have a good day, but it may be another stressful school day.</p>

Usually, my cousins are pretty well-behaved, but this time they were acting a little naughty. They had a lot of energy and they weren't listening to anything I was saying. I tried playing with them, but they weren't sharing the toys. Then, they were running around the house. My mom made us dinner. They wouldn't stay in their seats. My mom asked them to calm down. They eventually sat down and ate their dinner. After dinner, they were acting wild again, so I decided to ignore them and I turned on a movie. They saw what I was watching and sat down with me. They quickly got bored. They weren't watching the movie anymore. They started screaming and running around again. I wasn't having a good time with them. Finally, they got tired and fell asleep on my bed. I went out into the living room and watched television with my mom. We were both tired from the evening. We waited for my aunt and uncle to return.</p>

We scheduled the party for 6 o'clock but my grandparents came over early. I entertained them while Joe was getting ready. During the party, I helped my mom with the food while Joe was sharing stories about college. On Sunday, our family went to the ceremony. My father took many pictures while Joe was accepting his diploma. It was inspiring to see all of the people receive their degrees. It's a big accomplishment. I'm excited to get mine one day. But I have a long way to go.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">I saw a bizarre scene today. While I was walking downtown, a man ran out of a store. He nearly knocked me down. I think he stole something because two people were chasing him. He was running across the street when a car hit him. The car tried to stop but couldn't. The man rolled across the hood of the car and kept running. Then the police arrived. They tried to block the sidewalk but he just jumped over a fence into someone's yard. A dog ran out of the house and bit the man on the foot. He was trying to escape from the dog when the police caught him. They arrested him and took him to jail. I found out he took an expensive ring from the shop.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">When I was in grade school, I spent the summer in Spain. It was an amazing experience. I stayed with my grandparents and took language lessons during the day. I knew some Spanish when I got there but my ability improved a lot during my stay. I also learned a lot about the culture. I shared a bedroom with my cousin. She's the same age as me. We became very close. We spent a lot of time together. Many weekends, I toured different parts of the country with my aunt and uncle. We visited a lot of famous sites. I was sad that I had to leave when the summer was over. I decided to take a Spanish class when school started. I missed speaking Spanish with my cousin. We continued to write to each other for many years. She was my best pen pal. I am now fluent in Spanish. I definitely want to return to Spain one day.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">This weekend was incredibly hectic. I had too many things to do. On Saturday, I had soccer practice in the morning. I got hit by the ball really hard and broke my tooth. My coach said I could leave practice. My mother had to make a dentist appointment. The dentist doesn't usually work on the weekend, but it was an emergency. She said she could see me at noon. So, we rushed to the dentist office. After the dentist fixed my tooth and checked for any other damages to my teeth, we went to my haircut appointment. My family and I were invited to a wedding at 5 o'clock in the evening. I didn't want to go, but my mom couldn't find a babysitter. We stayed late at the reception. On Sunday, I was supposed to meet my friend at 9 o'clock to work on our school project. But I overslept and my mom didn't wake me up. She said she forgot about it. Then, she couldn't find her car keys, so we were really late. After I got home, I suddenly realized I didn't finish my homework. Now I have to stay up late to finish my history assignment.</p>

My parents and piano teacher said I was ready, but I didn't want to do it. My whole family was there to watch me. They were in the front row. I wanted to cry, but I held back my tears. My mom came backstage and comforted me. She told me she was very nervous at her first piano recital too. She said that it was normal to feel nervous. She said I could continue or skip the recital. She gave me a hug and I felt better. I went on stage and played my songs. Everyone clapped and took many pictures. I bowed and walked off the stage. I was really nervous, but I didn't make any mistakes. My piano teacher called me in the evening and said I did a great job. She said I could practice the next lesson or take a break next week. I chose to keep practicing. I love playing the piano.</p>

My grandfather picked us up at the train station. We borrowed their RV and traveled to other parts of the country. We either stayed in the RV or in motels at night. We saw many tourist attractions. Not only, did we go sightseeing, but we also visited our relatives. It was both fun and busy. I brought my camera and took pictures of famous buildings and skyscrapers. I'm very fascinated by them. I may want to be an architect one day. My dad brought his video camera, so he took both pictures and videos of our trip. My brother didn't have any fun. He neither likes traveling nor sightseeing. This was both a wonderful and memorable experience. I will never forget it. At the end of our trip, we drove back to my grandparent's house. We said good-bye to my grandparents at the train station. We were all ready to go home. We were not only tired, but also homesick. I miss my own bed.</p>

My mom sat with the teacher. Each student got a name tag. The zoo was crowded. There were other schools there. We saw many animals. I even saw an ostrich. I really wanted to see a tiger and an elephant. They are my favorite animals. I waited for the tiger, but it never came out. The zoo guide said it was asleep. I was so disappointed. I finally saw an elephant. It was huge. My mom took a picture of it. She took pictures of all the animals. I really enjoy learning about different animals. I think I want to be a veterinarian or a zookeeper one day. I have a desire to take care of them. We have a dog at home. I want to get a cat, but my mom is allergic to them. They make her sneeze. My mom printed all of the pictures for me. I made a scrapbook of all the animals. I labeled each picture. I want to keep it forever.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">I received my weekly allowance today. I made money by doing some chores around the house. I washed the dishes and mopped the floor. My mom said she would take me to the toy store. I saved up enough money to buy a dollhouse. When I got to the store, I saw many other fun things. There were a few dolls and puzzles that caught my eye. It was hard to choose. I looked at every item. We were there for a long time. We started to get hungry. My mom wanted to eat lunch and come back. We went to the restaurant next door. After we ate, we went back to the toy store. I finally made a decision. I decided to buy the dollhouse. I was so excited to go home and play with it. On the way home, my mom had to stop by the market and buy some groceries. She wanted to bake a cake. We didn't have any ingredients at home. She needed sugar and flour. She also bought some milk and cheese for my lunch tomorrow and meat for dinner tonight. Later in the evening, my dad helped me put the dollhouse together. There were a number of small pieces. It required much work and patience. When it was done, my dad took a picture of it. It was beautiful.</p>

She hung colorful balloons and streamers. She also put pretty flowers in round vases. It was beautiful. Her parents hired a clown. He had a red nose and curly hair. He did some magic tricks and told funny jokes. He made everyone laugh. We played some outdoor games and did face-painting. I got a little butterfly on my cheek. At the end of the party, we ate chocolate cake. Chocolate is my friend's favorite flavor. Then, she opened her presents. She got a lot of cool gifts. I gave her a pretty scarf in her favorite color. She loved it. She had a big smile on her face. She was a happy girl.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Yesterday was my first day at a new school. I made a few friends. I am usually the tallest kid in my class, but there was a boy taller than me. I really like my new teacher. She is very nice. She is nicer than my former teacher. My former teacher was the meanest teacher at school. I don't miss her at all. Today, I met a very pretty girl. She is the prettiest girl in my class. Our teacher assigned writing partners. She was my partner. We had to write a paragraph about ourselves. My story was longer than one paragraph. I wrote about moving to a new neighborhood. It was the scariest experience. I also wrote that it was colder here than my old city. I am used to hot weather, so I will have to buy warmer clothes. At lunchtime, I sat with a group of boys. We talked about playing basketball after school. We played with some boys that were younger than us. After playing outside, I had to finish my homework. It was harder than I expected. So, I stayed up past my bedtime. I hope I can wake up on time. I am walking to school with my new friends. Walking to school is shorter than riding the bus. The school bus makes too many stops. I really like my new school. I am having the greatest time.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">My brother and I had dentist appointments today. He was more nervous than me. Sometimes, we have to get shots in our mouths. They don't really hurt, but they make our mouths feel weird. I don't like the feeling. Last time, the dentist found two cavities on my brother's teeth. He was upset, but my mom was more upset than him. The dentist said that he needs to be more consistent with brushing his teeth after meals. I didn't have any cavities last time. I am more careful than my brother. He has had more cavities than me. I really like our dentist. She is the most patient person. My brother likes her too. Sometimes, my brother cries for a long time. He is afraid of pain. She explained to him that crying will make things more painful. She tries to tell jokes during the checkup. Today, she told a really funny joke. That made things more comfortable for us. Today, we didn't have any cavities. We were happy, but my mom was more relieved. Before we left, we each got a new toothbrush and a small toy. Today was the most pleasant visit to the dentist so far.</p>

They are the best animals in the world. They are loyal and good protectors. I like big dogs. Big dogs protect people better than small dogs. My dad said he had a dog when he was a child. He said it was the worst dog in the world. It never listened and tried to run away many times. I told my dad that dogs need proper training. My dad suggested that we get a fish. I didn't want a fish. They are boring. I think dogs are better pets than fish. My mom agreed with my dad. She said that fish are less maintenance than big dogs. I told them I would help take care of a dog. They said they wanted to get a pet that is the least amount of work. Every time I talked to them, I felt worse than before. I stopped asking for a dog. Then, one day I came home from school and there was a puppy in our living room. He had a big bow on his head. My parents surprised me with a puppy on my birthday. I asked if he could sleep on my bed. He is so cuddly. I have the best parents in the world.</p>
