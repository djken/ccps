It was during summer vacation. I fell off my bike and broke my arm. It was very painful, but my doctor was very nice. His name is Dr. Taylor. He is funny and very smart. <br><br> He graduated from Harvard Medical School. He speaks three different languages: English, Spanish, and German. His parents are from England and Germany, but he was born in Spain. I know a lot about him because he is not only my doctor, but also my uncle. I call him Uncle Simon. Although he is a busy doctor, he visits our family often. He comes over every Christmas. <br><br> Last Christmas he took my brother and me to watch Batman. This winter I hope he takes us to the movie theater again. He also reads to us. My favorite book is Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He is the coolest uncle and doctor. I want to be like him when I grow up.</p>

We are going to bring some balls and a Frisbee. <br><br> My dad is going to teach me how to play soccer. He taught my older brother too. My older brother does not want to join us today. He's a teenager now so he thinks he is too old to play at the park. I hope he changes his mind. It is going to be so much fun. My mother has been looking for our picnic basket. She did not find the basket, but she did find our picnic blanket. <br><br> My dad found the basket in the garage. After my mom packed all of the food, we said good-bye to my brother. As we were backing out of the driveway, my brother started running towards us. He said he wanted to go after all. He is going to bring a book to read. He wants to read under the trees and take a nap under the warm sun. We are going to make great memories together. I hope my dad packed the camera.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">I have a habit of biting my fingernails. My parents would scold me every time they noticed I chewed my nails. <br><br> I should stop biting them, but it's a hard habit to break. Sometimes, I don't realize I am doing it. I usually do it when I'm feeling anxious about something. My parents say it is a bad habit because nails carry germs that make people ill. My mother tried putting nail polish on my nails. <br><br> She was hoping that it would taste bitter, but it did not work. The taste did not bother me. My dad told me to put gloves on, but that only made me hot. What shall I do? <br><br> I will keep trying to stop. I think it would be easier if my parents did not pressure me about it. My sister used to bite her nails. She does not do it anymore. Maybe, I will break the habit soon.

I could sense something was wrong. <br><br> My father looked shocked. We rushed to the hospital. The doctor said she may have broken ribs. They were going to take some x-rays soon. They discovered she had several broken ribs, but no other injuries. She is a very lucky woman. <br><br> She was wearing her seatbelt. The doctor said she may be in the hospital for a couple of weeks. She might be able to leave earlier. It depends on her recovery. She can move, but she is in a lot of pain. Her injuries could get worse if she is not careful. <br><br>  She must wear a brace until her ribs heal. A nurse told us that a police officer was waiting in the waiting area. He said somebody witnessed the accident. The witness said my grandmother caused the crash. She did not hit a car. <br><br> She hit a pole. My parents don't think she can drive anymore. It is too dangerous. She might get into another accident. After she leaves the hospital, she may stay with my family while she gets physical therapy. We must take good care of her. She is very important to us.

My brother and sister have been very encouraging. They think I have a good chance to win. <br><br> There are a lot of students entering the contest this year. They all have great skills. I hope I can impress the judges. They are the teachers at my school. I will be fine if I don't win. I just want to be part of the show. <br><br> I think it will be lots of fun, but a little scary. I have never been on stage before. It will be my first time. I must start practicing soon. I will start today after school. My mother says I need to finish my homework first. She doesn't want me to fall behind on my studies. I can't wait until the show. <br><br> I call my best friend, Susan. She is very supportive. She says she's going to sit in the front row and cheer for me. I am lucky to have a great family and friends.

We usually shop and have lunch. We eat and talk about everything. That is my favorite part of our shopping trip. After we eat, we usually go back to the stores. This time, we ordered dessert. <br><br> We were still hungry. I had a slice of apple pie with ice cream. It was delicious. That restaurant has the best food. I tried on all of my new clothes after I got home. This was the best day. I really appreciate these new clothes. I especially love these new shoes and this new jacket.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">We lost our dog at the park yesterday. He was on a leash. The leash was old and it ripped apart. He got loose. He was running around in the park. All of a sudden he started running towards the street. He saw a dog on the other side of the street. <br><br> We ran towards him, but he kept running in the opposite direction. We lost sight of him. He disappeared so quickly. We called his name over and over again, but we couldn't find him. My dad went home and printed some signs. <br><br> We put a generous reward on the sign. We put them on trees and light posts. We even passed them out to strangers on the street. It was getting dark. I was so worried. My mom and I stayed at our house in case he came home. I missed him so much. <br><br> I couldn't sleep all night. He always slept on my bed. In the morning, someone called and said they saw him at the park again. The man on the phone said he didn't want the reward. He just wanted us to find our dog again. <br><br> He was such a nice man. We were so thankful. My parents and I rushed to the park. Our dog was waiting at the playground. I ran towards him. This time, he ran in our direction. I was so happy! I love my dog. <br><br> He is the best dog in the world. My dad bought a stronger leash at the pet store this morning. We put the leash on him, but I don't think he will run away anymore. I think he is happy to be home and on my bed.

A couple of my favorite singers were in it. <br><br> It was two hours of sheer entertainment. The best part of the musical was the ending. All of the singers and actors came on stage. It was an amazing performance. I took pictures of the whole cast. <br><br> My dad is going to help me make a scrapbook of all my photos. I think I will make one for my friend too. I can't stop singing all of the songs. I know all of the lyrics. The choir club at school is going to put on a musical. <br><br> I think it is set for the spring of next year. I may want to audition for a part. I'm a little shy, but this will help me boost my confidence. <br><br> We received a flyer at school regarding auditions a couple of weeks ago. I should have paid more attention to it. I think I threw it away. I know rehearsals are five days a week, Monday to Friday. I'm going to talk to the choir teacher tomorrow morning.</p>

I am so proud of her. The words were very difficult. They were given by the school principal. <br><br> The principal repeated the words several times and used them in sentences. That made the contest very long. It lasted over two hours. Some people were getting tired. <br><br> Other people moved by the door and windows to get some fresh air. After she spelled the winning word, the audience stood with applause. It was a great moment for her. <br><br> There is going to be a ceremony tomorrow night. The principal will present her with a big trophy with her name on it. It is going to be a special time for my family.</p>

Our teacher scolded her and sent her to the principal's office. He was not affected by her crying. <br><br> This was not the first time she was caught cheating. She has an excuse every time. Last time, her excuse was forgetting about the test. I think the teacher is getting tired of her lying. <br><br> She is good at making up excuses. This time our teacher involved the principal. They phoned her parents. Her parents hurried to school. We could see them through the window during recess. <br><br> They didn't look happy. Sharon is not a bad student. She is actually really creative. She has a great talent for drawing. She shows us a different picture each day. <br><br> Our teacher always compliments her artwork, but he also wants her to concentrate on learning. The teacher and the principal are going to give her one more chance. If she cheats again, she will get suspended from school. <br><br> She may even have to repeat the year. They are going to continue with monitoring her situation. I hope she stops cheating. She has good potential to be a great student.</p>

My mother wants to redo the kitchen and the bathroom. It also needs a new roof. New roofs are quite expensive. She wants to hire a contractor to do the work. She wants the work to be completed quickly. <br><br> My dad wants to save money on labor by doing the work alone. My dad has a lot of experience building and fixing things. He always fixes everything that needs repairs. His friends often ask him to help build or fix their broken items. My mom is more concerned about time. She wants it done fast. <br><br> I hope they can make a compromise. Some tasks are going to require more than one person to tackle. We can hire someone to do the extremely difficult tasks and my father can do the things that can be completed easily and quickly. I hope they agree on something soon. Home renovations can take a very long time..</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">I woke up late this morning. I did not hear my alarm clock. My mother attempted to wake me up. She gently shook my shoulder. That did not work, so she opened the curtains. The bright sun woke me up. What time is it? I jumped out of bed and ran to my closet. Where is my favorite shirt? I can't find anything in my bedroom. <br><br> Why is it so messy? There are clothes all over the floor. I need to clean my room after school. I don't have time to eat breakfast, so my mother packs a small snack. Where did I put my backpack? My mother hands it to me. I look out the window and see the bus. It just passed our house. <br><br>I missed the bus again. When did it come? I think it was early today. My mom is not happy with me. Why do I keep missing the bus? What is my problem? My mother has to drive me to school. I hope she won't be late for work. She has an important meeting this morning. I appreciate everything she does for me. Tomorrow, I won't be late.</p>

The janitor finds leftover paint in the school basement. It matches the wall color. <br><br>Each student grabs a paint brush and we start painting over the graffiti. The principal is very impressed with the students. We decide that we want to paint a mural on one of the walls. Who wants to design the picture? Everyone wants to contribute. It's going to be beautiful.</p>

My mother speaks to them often.<br><br> Since she is the oldest child, she frequently contacts her parents and siblings. My cousins will be arriving after I get back from school. Their airplane arrives around 4 o'clock. My father is going to pick them up at the airport. My mother is going to make dinner for everyone. <br><br>She is making a combination of traditional Korean dishes and American dishes. I plan to sneak a taste because we cannot eat until everyone gets here. <br><br>I am nervous and excited about meeting them again. I hope they can speak English. I cannot speak Korean very well anymore. Maybe, I can learn Korean from them. I think once we spend time together, we will become close again.</p>

I have to agree with her. I don't think it will be fun if everything is wet and soggy. What do we do if the tent leaks? Although we all like the outdoors, my mom and I would prefer to go during dry weather.<br><br> My dad really wants to go camping because he got a new tent for his birthday. He is excited to use it. He doesn't think the tent will leak because it is new. I hope we pack some umbrellas and tarp because we may need it. <br><br>I hope the trip is canceled if it rains. Unless there is a snowstorm, I think we are going to go this weekend. I will cross my fingers for good luck.</p>

We wanted to show them our appreciation by throwing them a big party.<br><br> My sister invited all of their close friends. We secretly called and emailed them. We got the house ready while they were out with some friends.<br><br> Their friends kept them busy while we were decorating. They promised not to say a word about the party. We trusted them. We had a hard time finding a place to hide the decorations. <br><br>We didn't know where to put them. So we stored them at our neighbor's house across the street. When they left with their friends, we brought all the decorations back and started hanging streamers and balloons. I made a big sign with markers and glitter. <br><br>It looked very fancy. My sister really liked it. She was in charge of the food and guest list. <br><br>Everyone arrived on time. When my parents came home, they turned on the lights and we all screamed, “Surprise!” They were indeed surprised and very happy. It was a fantastic party.</p>

I have many memories of them; however, I know it is time to get rid of them. I just had a birthday and I received new toys. <br><br>I have to clean out the closets first, then I can add my new items.

My favorite ride is the roller coaster that goes upside-down.<br><br> It is so much fun. My sister cannot ride it. She has severe motion sickness. She gets nauseous on it. <br><br>She rides the ones for little kids. They are not very fast. My mom stays with her while my father rides with me.<br><br> He enjoys roller coasters too. My mom thinks they are scary. We are supposed to leave at 10 o'clock. What time is it? Is it time to go yet? <br><br> I'm so excited! We don't go often because the tickets are not cheap. They cost a lot of money. <br><br> My parents saved up for this special day. They are great parents! We are currently waiting for my father. He is running some errands. He went to the bank, gas station, and store. <br><br> He should be home soon. Where is he? We can leave when he gets back. It's going to be an awesome day!</p>

                        We moved to a new house. My father's job was transferred to another state. My parents bought a house close to my father's new office. Our new house is also close to my school and my brother and sister's school. They are in high school. I'm still in elementary school. We shipped my mother's car and we drove my father's car. The moving truck came this morning. We have so many boxes to unpack. I can't locate any of my things. I opened a box and found my brother's and sister's clothes and shoes. Where is my stuff? I opened another box and found my mother's jewelry and toiletries. I looked through several boxes. I finally found some of my things. They were in the back of the moving truck. I wanted to find my favorite stuffed bear. I sleep with it every night. It is very special to me. My godmother gave it to me. She is my mother's best friend. They have known each other for many years. We are going to miss her. She is going to visit us during the summer. My grandparents' vacation home is only an hour away. We plan to meet there for some summer fun. I need to find my travel journal. Maybe, my other things are in my parents' room. We forgot to label the boxes, so they are all in random rooms.

                        My entire family is going to Hawaii this summer. We want to rent a condo. We need a place that has three bedrooms. My parents and I are going to share one bedroom. My brother and sister-in-law will use the second bedroom. My grandparents will have the third bedroom. We would also like at least two bathrooms. My mom is arranging the whole trip. She is a travel agent. She is looking for a condo that has a big dining table so we can eat together. I hope the place has an outdoor swimming pool. My mother found a condo on the top floor. It is also walking distance to the beach. We got a great deal on it. We got a discount because we reserved several weeks in advance. The description is very nice. She booked our flight early so we could get an early-bird deal on airfare. It's going to be a memorable trip.

                    <p class="text-justify">I have my first babysitting job this weekend. I will be watching my cousin for several days. My aunt and uncle are going on a weeklong trip. They rented an oceanfront condo on the beach. They are going to celebrate their ten-year anniversary. My aunt and uncle trust me to take care of their eight-year-old daughter. They know I am responsible teenager. My mother will also be home with us just in case of an emergency. I made a list of things we can do. We can play games and watch age-appropriate movies. My cousin is creative, so I want to take her to a pottery-painting studio. She is very sweet and well-behaved, so there shouldn't be any problems. We get along really well. I remember when she was born. She was so tiny. She was a premature baby. Now she is healthy and strong. She is so special to all of us. While she is staying with us, we are going to take her back-to-school shopping. We love to look for end-of-summer bargains. We've also been having record-breaking heat, so we'll go swimming at the community pool. We're going to have a great time together.</p>

                            We had a power outage last night. There was a big storm and it knocked down several power lines in our neighborhood. My mother had to light some candles because it was too dark in the house. My little brother was scared. I was afraid too. We are both afraid of the dark. When I went to the bathroom, my brother went with me too. We had to carry a lantern. The trees were swaying back and forth. It was too windy outside. I thought the trees were going to fall over too. My parents did not want to risk a falling tree. So we spent the evening in the basement. It was cold downstairs, but safe for everyone. There is a bedroom and a bathroom downstairs too. We all slept there. We brought all the blankets from our beds. We grabbed blankets from the linen closet too. I tried to carry a stack of blankets, but it was too heavy for me. My brother carried the pillows. It was a slumber party with my family. The power returned in the morning. We had fun last night, but it is better to have electricity.

                                Our class is going on a field trip next month. Our teacher gave us three options. Our class took a vote. The majority of the class chose to go to the city's largest aquarium. We went to the zoo last year, so we decided to go to the aquarium this year. It's a huge place with so many water species. I can't wait! It's going to be so much fun! I love sea life, so the aquarium is very fun for me. I have been there several times, but it is never boring. My father is a marine biologist, so I know a lot about sea mammals. My favorite mammals are the dolphins and sea lions. I like seals and walruses too. You can see them swim at the aquarium. Sometimes, they swim in the same pool. You have to watch carefully because they come by so quickly. One of my favorite things to do at the aquarium is looking at the starfish. The staff will let you touch them too. You have to be very careful and gentle. It is so cool. My teacher knows that my dad is a marine biologist, so she asked if he could give a short presentation to the class. He is very excited to talk about marine life. It's his passion. He is going to talk to my class next week, so he is going to prepare his slideshow this weekend. We are all so excited about this field trip.

                                Our washer is broken. It started leaking this morning. My mother went downstairs to the basement and saw water all over the floor. It was such a big mess. We called the repairman, but he doesn't work on the weekends. Having a broken appliance is such an inconvenience. My mother decided to go to the laundromat. We live on the top floor of an apartment building. We don't have an elevator, so we had to carry the laundry baskets down several flights of stairs. It was such a pain! Our neighbor helped us carry a couple of baskets. He was such a big help. We had to do several loads of laundry, so it took a few hours. My mother forgot to bring coins for the washer and dryer. They do not accept paper money. Luckily, there was a machine that exchanges paper money for coins. I forgot to bring a book or magazine, so I was bored. It was such a nice day outside, but I had to stay with my mom. Our laundry was finally done, so we went home. We had to bring all of the clean clothes back upstairs. That was such a chore!

                                My family and I went camping during the summer. We brought a big tent. It was large enough for our whole family. We slept in sleeping bags. My mom packed extra blankets just in case it wasn't warm enough at night. We had a blast! We went swimming in the lake. My mom was worried the water would not be warm enough, but it was the perfect temperature. One day we had to look for branches because my dad did not pack enough firewood for the campfire. It was fun searching for wood sticks and branches. We turned it into a family game. I wasn't old enough to wander around alone, so my mom searched with me. There was also a zip-line close by. Unfortunately, I was not tall enough to ride on it. There was a height restriction. We ate really well too. My mom packed enough food for an army. There was plenty to eat. We roasted hot dogs and marshmallows over the campfire. At night, my brother played music on his guitar. We all sang and danced together. After a few days, it was time to leave. There wasn't enough time to do everything. My dad promised to bring us back here next year. I wish we could bring our dog too. But there is not enough space in the car for him. We are going to make camping an annual family tradition. We just need a bigger car.

                                I have to write a biography about a famous person. I can choose any person who is alive or deceased. I don't have any ideas. I'm going to the library tonight. Hopefully, I'll be able to find some good books to read. I have three weeks to finish the assignment. I searched online, but I didn't get any inspirations. This is going to take some time. I need to get a good grade on this book report. It counts for the majority of my history grade. When we got to the library, there weren't any parking spots left. It must be a busy night. There were some spots available across the street. When we got inside, there weren't many biographies left. Many books were already checked out. I walked up and down the aisles. There were some books on former presidents and leaders of the world. But I didn't want to pick any person. I want to write about a person with some character. My older brother tried to give me some ideas, but they didn't interest me. After a couple of hours, he wanted to leave. He doesn't have any patience. I was desperate, so I decided to pick up any book. Then, I saw the ideal book for me. My favorite subject is science, so I should write about my favorite scientist. His name is Albert Einstein.

                                Our class went on an overnight field trip. We raised enough money to visit a national park. Since it was a few hours away, we stayed in a lodge by the park. Before we planned this trip, each student was required to get a parent's signature for permission. Every student was allowed to attend. Our teacher requested several chaperones. She said either parent could sign up. My mother wanted to go, but she was sick. She attended every field trip each year. My father had to work, so neither parent was able to go. I was sad about it, but I understood their situations. We had three girls and a female chaperone in my room. The boys had male chaperones on another floor. There were two sets of bunkbeds in each room. We could sleep on either top or bottom. I chose the bottom because I'm afraid of heights. I also don't like climbing up ladders. My friends know about my fear, so they didn't mind either way. In the morning, we had to get ready to ride the bus to the park. There were two bathrooms on each floor. We were allowed to use either bathroom to shower. Before we left the lodge, my teacher checked every room to make sure we didn't leave anything behind. We had a great time during this field trip. We learned a lot about the natural habitat of the park.

                                My school is doing a fundraiser. We are trying to raise money for new gym equipment. We need money to replace all of the old and worn-out athletic gear. Half the items have not been updated for many years. We are putting on a concert. All of the proceeds from the ticket sales will go to the Physical Education department. My brother is a singer. He is going to sing with his friend. Both of them are really good singers. They sound like professional musicians. Anyone can participate in the concert. Our music teacher is organizing this event. She is working with the school coach. Both teachers are excited to support this school function. Also, half the school has signed up to have a part in the concert. All of the students have great school spirit. I hope we raise enough money to help the PE department. PE and Music are usually the last departments to get any money from the school budget. Both departments need a lot of support. Academics are important. But PE and Music are important too. Maybe, this fundraiser will motivate all of us to do another one for the Music department.
