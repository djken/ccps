She has a broken hip and a lot of bruises. She had surgery on Friday. The doctor fixed her hip. He inserted some metal pins into the bone. <br><br>The pins hold the bone together. She has to stay in the hospital for a few weeks. She needs to stay in bed so her hip can heal. The hospital is boring. She doesn't have many things to do. I am going to visit her a few times every week. We can play cards or watch movies together.</p>

We all went to the library, but she wasn't there. <br><br>She didn't show up. We had to finish without her. I called her home. Her mom said she was at a friend's house. I saw her at school the next day.<br><br> She said she didn't know about the meeting but I know she wasn't telling the truth. We reminded her many times. I really don't want work with her anymore.</p>

Then, we came home and my mom made us lunch. We wanted to have a picnic in the backyard.<br><br> My mom made sandwiches. We laid out a blanket on the grass. After we finished our lunch, my brother and I threw away our trash. My mom came outside with us to work in the yard. There was a storm last weekend so it was still a mess.<br><br> The wind blew a lot of debris onto the lawn. I helped to rake the lawn and my brother mowed the grass. Many weeds grew in the garden this week. I pulled the weeds and my mom planted some new flowers. Then my dad came home after work. We decided to have a barbecue. <br><br>We cooked hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill and relaxed in the yard. I'm so glad the weather is nice again.</p>

He finally showed up with his parents. He didn't even say he was sorry. He said he forgot. <br><br>I didn't believe him, but I forgave him anyway. His parents didn't even know I was coming. He didn't tell them. When we finally sat down to study, he turned on some loud music. <br><br>His mom told him to turn it down because it was too noisy. Instead, he started singing really loudly. I finally had enough and went home. When I get mad at him, he doesn't even care. I don't know if I want to be his friend anymore.</p>

Tacos are my favorite. Plus, I finally found my library book. It was missing for two weeks. <br><br>My mom accidentally put it away in my sister's room. Only one bad thing happened. I fought with my sister. She borrowed a dress from me and spilled something on it. She is going to get it cleaned but I'm worried that it is ruined. Otherwise it was a perfect day.</p>

Sometimes, I fall asleep. Other times, I bring a video to watch in the car. <br><br>When we arrived, my grandmother was cooking my favorite food, spaghetti and meatballs. On Saturday, we went to the park and I met a friendly dog. We also went to the petting zoo in the park and fed the animals. A goose bit my finger. <br><br>My finger bled, but I didn't cry. My grandmother put a bandage on it and it felt better. In the evening, we went out to dinner and saw a movie. On Sunday, we walked along the beach to collect seashells.<br><br> My grandfather said he knew an area that had a lot of shells. So, he led us there. I collected so many shells. I'm going save them in a big shoebox. I love spending time with my grandparents. I can't wait to go back.</p>
